Serverless architecture provides automatic scalability, cost-efficiency, simplified operations, but can have higher latency and execution time limits. Traditional server-based architecture offers control and flexibility, predictable latency, support for long-running tasks, but requires manual maintenance and can be more expensive. Containerized applications can fit into this comparison by considering factors such as cold start latency, concurrent executions, resource limitations, and vendor lock-in. When comparing the maintenance costs between serverless and server-based architectures, serverless hosting is typically cheaper to maintain as the cloud provider is responsible for maintenance and administration. The decision on which approach is best for hosting a digital marketplace depends on factors such as usage patterns, maintenance requirements, and vendor lock-in.

Some of the key benefits include reducing stress and anxiety, improving focus and concentration, enhancing emotional well-being, lowering blood pressure, boosting the immune system, and increasing self-awareness. To get started with meditation, it's recommended to start small, focus on the breath, use guided apps if desired, and find a quiet spot if possible. Different techniques can be used to reach a meditative state, such as Vipassana, self-inquiry, and visualization. The physical health benefits of meditation are thought to be a result of improved mental health, relaxation, and physiological changes in the body, including reduced stress, lower blood pressure, improved sleep, reduced pain, improved immune function, and reduced inflammation. Meditation can also indirectly improve physical health by promoting healthier lifestyle choices.
