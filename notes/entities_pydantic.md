# Guide to Writing Pydantic Classes for Structured Data Modeling
## Introduction to Pydantic
`Pydantic` is a Python library used for data validation and settings management. It utilizes Python type annotations for validating data types in classes.

Starting with a Basic Pydantic Class
Begin by defining a basic Pydantic class, representing a generic `Entity` or data model.

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

class Entity(BaseModel):
name: str
description: str
```
### Creating Specific Variations through Subclassing
Extend the basic class into more specialized versions by subclassing. This creates specific variations of the generic entity.

```python
class PersonEntity(Entity):
age: int
gender: str

class VehicleEntity(Entity):
make: str
model: str
year: int
```
`PersonEntity` and `VehicleEntity` are examples of more specific versions of the `Entity` class.

### Nested Classes for Complex Structures
Use classes as types for attributes in other classes to create nested structures.

```python
class License(BaseModel):
license_number: str
vehicle: VehicleEntity
```
This is useful for representing complex structures where one entity contains another.

### Building Hierarchical Data Models
Construct hierarchies by combining subclasses and nested classes. This approach is ideal for representing interrelated data structures.

```python
class EmployeeEntity(PersonEntity):
employee_id: str
department: str
vehicle: VehicleEntity
```

`EmployeeEntity` is an example of a subclass of `PersonEntity` that includes a nested VehicleEntity.

### Implementing Validation and Constraints
Use Pydantic's validation features to add constraints to your data models.

```python
from pydantic import Field

class ProductEntity(Entity):
price: float = Field(gt=0, description="Price must be greater than zero")
in_stock: bool
```

This example demonstrates how to ensure that the price attribute is always greater than zero.

### Utilizing Advanced Features
Consider exploring Pydantic's advanced features like custom validators, generic models, and settings management for more complex scenarios.

### Example Usage
```python
person = PersonEntity(name="John Doe", description="A software engineer", age=30, gender="Male")
vehicle = VehicleEntity(name="Tesla", description="Electric Car", make="Tesla", model="Model S", year=2020)
license = License(license_number="XYZ1234", vehicle=vehicle)
```

### Conclusion
Pydantic's subclassing and nested class capabilities allow for the creation of detailed, structured, and hierarchical data models. This method is particularly useful in complex systems where maintaining data integrity and clear entity relationships is crucial.
