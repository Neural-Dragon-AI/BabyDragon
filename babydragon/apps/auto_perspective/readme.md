# Perspective-Driven Prompting

This repository contains a novel AI Chatbot creation pipeline. The aim is to
build chatbots that can generate responses based on a specific theory or
perspective defined by the user. It aims to guide AI models to produce responses
that are not only contextually accurate but also reflective of the specific
viewpoint or theory provided by the user, resulting in a more personalized and
insightful interaction.

## Overview

Our pipeline consists of six main stages, harnessing the power of GPT3.5, GPT4,
and Cohere models. It starts with a user-defined theory or perspective,
generates a wealth of knowledge from Wikipedia, clusters, summarizes and,
finally, designs chatbot prompts based on the user's initial input. The
resulting chatbot responses are then evaluated for relevance and insightfulness.

## Pipeline Stages

1. **User Input**: The user defines a theory or perspective from which they wish
   to view the world. The user input is then processed using the following
   prompts to generate rich and contextually relevant ideas:

   ```
   a) "Generate ideas and concepts that explore the connection between {user_subject} and {user_perspective}, considering both traditional and unconventional approaches."
   ```

   ```
   b) "List key concepts or topics that would help analyze {user_subject} through the lens of {user_perspective}, including relevant principles, theories, or models."
   ```

   ```
   c) "Identify potential areas or research topics where {user_subject} and {user_perspective} intersect, highlighting intriguing or innovative perspectives."

   ```

2. **Knowledge Generation**: An ensemble of GPT3.5 and Cohere models generate
   multiple seeds that we use to retrieve up to 100k tokens of information from
   Wikipedia.

3. **Clustering**: These tokens are then organized into clusters of 10k tokens
   each, creating a kernel of information that is manageable and ready for
   summarization.

4. **Summarization**: Cohere summarization models summarize each cluster into up
   to 600 tokens per cluster. The summarization process is guided by the
   following prompt:

   ```
   "Summarize the main concepts, ideas, and intersection points of {user_subject} and {user_perspective} in a concise and structured manner, so that the information can be used to design a context-aware and perspective-driven prompt for a chatbot. Make sure to emphasize key insights, relevant principles, and any prominent theories or models that can serve as a foundation for generating rich and engaging chatbot responses."

   ```

5. **Prompt Creation**: GPT generates a chatbot prompt using the summarized
   information and the user-defined perspective. The prompt aims to structure
   the chatbot's response in a way that reflects the user's initial input. The
   prompt creation is guided by the following instructions:

   ```
   " With the summarized information from Cohere about the essential ideas, concepts, principles, and intersection points between {user_subject} and {user_perspective}, construct an appealing and context-aware chatbot prompt that impels the chatbot to respond with insights and perspectives born from the synergy of these two domains. Use the tips below to help you create an effective chatbot prompt: 1. Begin with a concise introduction: Initiate the chatbot prompt by setting the context, encompassing the user's specified subject and perspective. 2. Accentuate the intersection: Secure that the chatbot prompt underlines the connection between the user_subject and user_perspective, leading to more pertinent and perceptive responses. 3. Foster exploration: Ensure the chatbot prompt provokes the chatbot to delve into the main ideas, principles, and concepts from the summaries with a thoughtful and reflective approach. 4. Pose open-ended questions: Incorporate open-ended queries in the chatbot prompt, stimulating the chatbot to contemplate beyond the summaries and offer comprehensive responses. 5. Prioritize simplicity: Maintain the chatbot prompt's clarity and brevity, assisting the chatbot in comprehending the context and reacting suitably. 6. Steer the conversation: Craft the chatbot prompt in a manner that subtly directs the chatbot's answers, confirming they consistently focus on the user_subject and user_perspective. By leveraging these tips, develop a chatbot prompt that generates responses illustrative of the user's specified subject and perspective, culminating in a customized and significant interaction."

   ```

6. **Response Evaluation**: The final stage involves a comprehensive evaluation
   of the responses generated by Cohere, GPT3.5, and GPT4 models. This
   evaluation is not only based on the chatbot prompt but also includes a
   detailed analysis using the Cohere Classifier API. This classifier is trained
   on the same index used to create the user-defined perspective, ensuring its
   alignment with the expected output.

The effectiveness of the influence of the prompt is then determined by comparing
the classifier scores between the prompted and unprompted model responses. A
higher score indicates a stronger alignment with the user-defined perspective,
thus reflecting a more successful implementation of our Perspective-Driven
Prompting methodology.

By combining relevance, depth of insight, and adherence to the user-defined
perspective with the sophisticated classification scoring, this stage ensures
that the final chatbot response is contextually accurate, insightful, and truly
reflective of the user's perspective.
