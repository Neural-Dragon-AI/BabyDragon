If it is an empty cell, it recursively explores its neighboring cells to update the board appropriately.\n\n8. `Solution` class: This class encapsulates the above-defined functions as methods.", "prompt_tokens": 2802, "completion_tokens": 679, "total_tokens": 3481, "end_time": 1691086186}
{"id": 71, "start_time": 1691086164, "output": "The code provided consists of multiple functions and classes. \n\n1. The first function initializes a class called \"KthLargest\" with parameters k and nums. It initializes an attribute called \"pool\" with the value of nums and another attribute called \"k\" with the value of k. It then converts the \"pool\" list into a heap using the \"heapify\" function from the \"heapq\" module. The function then removes elements from the \"pool\" heap until the length of the \"pool\" heap becomes less than or equal to k.\n\n2. The second function is an \"add\" method of the \"KthLargest\" class. It takes an additional argument called val. The method checks if the length of the \"pool\" heap is less than k. If so, it adds the val to the \"pool\" heap using the \"heappush\" function from the \"heapq\" module. Otherwise, it checks if the val is greater than the minimum element of the \"pool\" heap (which is the first element of the \"pool\" heap). If so, it replaces the minimum element of the \"pool\" heap with val using the \"heapreplace\" function from the \"heapq\" module. Finally, it returns the first element of the \"pool\" heap.\n\n3. The third function is a class called \"Solution\" with a method called \"findMaxAverage\". This method takes two arguments: nums (a list of integers) and k (an integer). The method calculates the sum of the first k elements of the nums list and assigns it to the variable sm. It then calculates the average of sm and assigns it to the variable mx. It also initializes j as 0. Then it iterates over the range from k to the length of nums. In each iteration, it adds the current element of nums to sm and subtracts the element at index j from sm. It then calculates the average of sm and assigns it to curr. It updates the value of mx to be the maximum of curr and mx. Finally, it increments j by 1. After the loop ends, it returns the value of mx.\n\n4. The fourth function is a function called \"subarraySum\" that takes three arguments: nums (a list of integers), k (an integer), and self (which suggests that this might be a method of a class). The function initializes a dictionary called sums, a variable called res with a value of 0, and a variable called sm with a value of 0. It then iterates over the range of the length of nums. In each iteration, it checks if the value of sm is in the sums dictionary. If so, it increments the value associated with sm in the sums dictionary by 1. Otherwise, it assigns 1 as the value associated with sm in the sums dictionary. Then it adds the current element of nums to sm. It checks if the difference between sm and k is in the sums dictionary. If so, it increments the value of res by the value associated with the difference in the sums dictionary. Finally, it returns the value of res.\n\n5. The fifth function is a class called \"Solution\" with a method called \"subarraySum\". This method takes two arguments: nums (a list of integers) and k (an integer). The method implements the same logic as the previous function in a different way. It initializes a dictionary called sums, a variable called res with a value of 0, and a variable called sm with a value of 0. It then iterates over the range of the length of nums. In each iteration, it checks if the value of sm is in the sums dictionary. If so, it increments the value associated with sm in the sums dictionary by 1. Otherwise, it assigns 1 as the value associated with sm in the sums dictionary. Then it adds the current element of nums to sm. It checks if the difference between sm and k is in the sums dictionary. If so, it increments the value of res by the value associated with the difference in the sums dictionary. Finally, it returns the value of res.\n\n6. The sixth function is a function called \"numSubarrayProductLessThanK\" that takes two arguments: nums (a list of integers) and k (an integer). The function initializes variables l and res with values of 0. It also initializes a variable cur with a value of 1. It then iterates over the range of the length of nums. In each iteration, it multiplies the current element of nums with cur and assigns the result to cur. It then enters a while loop that continues until cur becomes greater than or equal to k and l is less than the current index i. In each iteration of the while loop, it increments the value of l by 1 and divides cur by the element of nums at index l. When the condition of the while loop is no longer satisfied (i.e., cur is less than k), it adds the value of i minus l plus 1 to res. Finally, it returns the value of res.\n\n7. The seventh function is a class called \"Solution\" with a method called \"numSubarrayProductLessThanK\". This method takes two arguments: nums (a list of integers) and k (an integer). The method implements the same logic as the previous function in a different way. It initializes variables l and res with values of 0. It also initializes a variable cur with a value of 1. It then iterates over the range of the length of nums. In each iteration, it multiplies the current element of nums with cur and assigns the result to cur. It then enters a while loop that continues until cur becomes greater than or equal to k and l is less than the current index i. In each iteration of the while loop, it increments the value of l by 1 and divides cur by the element of nums at index l. When the condition of the while loop is no longer satisfied (i.e., cur is less than k), it adds the value of i minus l plus 1 to res. Finally, it returns the value of res.\n\n8. The eighth function is a function called \"dietPlanPerformance\" that takes four arguments: calories (a list of integers), k (an integer), lower (an integer), and upper (an integer). The function initializes a variable sm with the sum of the first k elements of the calories list. It also initializes a variable points with a value of (sm > upper) - (sm < lower), which is 1 if sm is greater than upper, -1 if sm is less than lower, and 0 otherwise. It then enters a for loop that iterates over the range from k to the length of the calories list. In each iteration, it adds the difference between the current element of calories and the element of calories at index i - k to sm. It also updates the value of points by adding (sm > upper) - (sm < lower) to it. Finally, it returns the value of points.\n\n9. The ninth function is a function called \"maxNumber\" that takes three arguments: nums1 (a list of integers), nums2 (a list of integers), and k (an integer). The function defines two inner functions: \"merge\" and \"makeArr\". The \"merge\" function takes two arguments: arr1 and arr2 (both lists of integers). It initializes an empty list called res. It also initializes two variables i and j with values of 0. It then enters a while loop that continues until i is less than the length of arr1 and j is less than the length of arr2. In each iteration of the while loop, it compares the sublists arr1[i:] and arr2[j:]. If arr1[i:] is greater than or equal to arr2[j:], it appends the first element of arr1[i:] to res and increments i by 1. Otherwise, it appends the first element of arr2[j:] to res and increments j by 1. After the while loop ends, it checks if there are any remaining elements in arr1. If so, it appends the remaining elements of arr1 to res. If not, it checks if there are any remaining elements in arr2. If so, it appends the remaining elements of arr2 to res. Finally, it returns res. The \"makeArr\" function takes two arguments: arr (a list of tuples) and l (an integer). It initializes a variable i with a value of 0 and an empty list called res. It then enters a for loop that iterates over the range from l - 1 to -1 with a step of -1. In each iteration, it assigns the maximum value of arr[i:-r] or arr[i:] to the variable num. It also assigns -i + 1 to i. Finally, it appends num to res. After the loop ends, it returns res. The main body of the function initializes nums1, nums2, and choices. It then enters a for loop that iterates over the range from k + 1. In each iteration, it checks if the value of m is greater than the length of nums1 or k - m is greater than the length of nums2. If so, it continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, it assigns the value of makeArr(nums1, m) to arr1 and the value of makeArr(nums2, k - m) to arr2. It then appends the result of merging arr1 and arr2 to choices. Finally, it returns the maximum value of choices.\n\n10. The tenth function is a class called \"Solution\" with a method called \"maxNumber\". This method implements the same logic as the previous function in a different way.\n\n11. The eleventh function is a function called \"maxSubArrayLen\" that takes two arguments: nums (a list of integers) and k (an integer). The function initializes a dictionary called index, a variable called l with a value of 0, and a variable called sm with a value of 0. It also assigns -1 to the value associated with 0 in the index dictionary. It then iterates over the range of the length of nums. In each iteration, it adds the current element of nums to sm. It checks if the difference between sm and k is a key in the index dictionary. If so, it calculates the maximum value of l and the difference between the current index and the value associated with the difference in the index dictionary, and assigns it to l. It then checks if sm is not a key in the index dictionary. If so, it assigns the current index to the value associated with sm in the index dictionary. Finally, it returns the value of l.\n\n12. The twelfth function is a class called \"Solution\" with a method called \"maxSubArrayLen\". This method implements the same logic as the previous function in a different way.\n\n13. The thirteenth function is a function called \"kConcatenationMaxSum\" that takes two arguments: arr (a list of integers) and k (an integer). The function defines an inner function called \"Kadane\" that takes an optional argument called \"res\" with a default value of 0 and an optional argument called \"cur\" with a default value of 0. The \"Kadane\" function iterates over the elements of arr and updates the values of \"cur\" and \"res\" to find the maximum sum of any subarray. The main body of the function returns ((k - 2) * max(sum(arr), 0) + Kadane(arr * 2)) mod 1000000007 if k is greater than 1, otherwise it returns Kadane(arr) mod 1000000007.\n\n14. The fourteenth function is a function called \"countPairsLTE\" that takes two arguments: array (a sorted list of integers) and value (an integer). The function uses the bisect module to calculate the number of pairs of elements in the array that are less than or equal to the given value.\n\n15. The fifteenth function is a function called \"smallestDistancePair\" that takes two arguments: nums (a list of integers) and k (an integer). The function first sorts the nums list. It then initializes variables low and high. The low variable is assigned the minimum difference between consecutive elements in the nums list, and the high variable is assigned the difference between the last element of the nums list and the first element of the nums list. The function then enters a while loop that continues until the low variable is less than the high variable. In each iteration of the while loop, it calculates the midpoint of the low and high variables and assigns it to the variable mid. It then checks if the number of pairs with distance less than or equal to mid is less than the value of k. If so, it updates the value of low to be mid + 1. Otherwise, it updates the value of high to be mid. Finally, it returns the value of low.\n\n16. The sixteenth function is a class called Solution with two methods: \"countPairsLTE\" and \"smallestDistancePair\". The methods implement the same logic as the previous functions in a different way.\n\n17. The seventeenth function is a function called \"findClosestElements\" that takes three arguments: arr (a list of integers), k (an integer), and x (an integer). The function initializes variables ind and n. The ind variable is assigned the index in the arr list where the value of x should be inserted to maintain sorted order. The n variable is assigned the length of the arr list. The function then checks if the ind variable is greater than 0 and if the difference between x and the element of arr at index ind - 1 is less than the difference between the element at index ind and x. If so, it decrements the value of ind by 1. The function then initializes variables l and r with the values of ind and ind + 1, respectively. It enters a for loop that iterates for k - 1 times. In each iteration, it checks if the value of r is greater than or equal to n or if the difference between x and the element of arr at index l - 1 is less than or equal to the difference between the element at index r and x. If so, it decrements the value of l by 1. Otherwise, it increments the value of r by 1. Finally, it returns the sublist of arr from index l to index r.\n\n18. The eighteenth function is a function called \"findKthLargest\" that takes two arguments: nums (a list of integers) and k (an integer). The function uses the heapq module to efficiently find the kth largest element in the nums list.\n\n19. The nineteenth function is a class called Solution with a method called \"findKthLargest\". This method implements the same logic as the previous function in a different way.", "prompt_tokens": 2323, "completion_tokens": 3087, "total_tokens": 5410, "end_time": 1691086165}
