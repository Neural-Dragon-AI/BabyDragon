 # Perspective-Driven Prompting

This repository contains a novel AI Chatbot creation pipeline. The aim is to build chatbots that can generate responses based on a specific theory or perspective defined by the user. It aims to guide AI models to produce responses that are not only contextually accurate but also reflective of the specific viewpoint or theory provided by the user, resulting in a more personalized and insightful interaction.


## Overview

Our pipeline consists of six main stages, harnessing the power of GPT3.5, GPT4, and Cohere models. It starts with a user-defined theory or perspective, generates a wealth of knowledge from Wikipedia, clusters, summarizes and, finally, designs chatbot prompts based on the user's initial input. The resulting chatbot responses are then evaluated for relevance and insightfulness.

## Pipeline Stages

1. **User Input**: The user defines a theory or perspective from which they wish to view the world. The user input is then processed using the following prompts to generate rich and contextually relevant ideas:

    a) "Generate ideas and concepts that explore the connection between {user_subject} and {user_perspective}, considering both traditional and unconventional approaches."

    b) "List key concepts or topics that would help analyze {user_subject} through the lens of {user_perspective}, including relevant principles, theories, or models."

    c) "Identify potential areas or research topics where {user_subject} and {user_perspective} intersect, highlighting intriguing or innovative perspectives."

2. **Knowledge Generation**: An ensemble of GPT3.5 and Cohere models generate multiple seeds that we use to retrieve up to 100k tokens of information from Wikipedia.

3. **Clustering**: These tokens are then organized into clusters of 10k tokens each, creating a kernel of information that is manageable and ready for summarization.

4. **Summarization**: Cohere summarization models summarize each cluster into up to 600 tokens per cluster. The summarization process is guided by the following prompt:

    "Summarize the main concepts, ideas, and intersection points of {user_subject} and {user_perspective} in a concise and structured manner, so that the information can be used to design a context-aware and perspective-driven prompt for a chatbot. Make sure to emphasize key insights, relevant principles, and any prominent theories or models that can serve as a foundation for generating rich and engaging chatbot responses."

5. **Prompt Creation**: GPT generates a chatbot prompt using the summarized information and the user-defined perspective. The prompt aims to structure the chatbot's response in a way that reflects the user's initial input. The prompt creation is guided by the following instructions:

    "Using the summarized information from Cohere about the key ideas, concepts, principles, and intersection points between {user_subject} and {user_perspective}, create an engaging and context-aware chatbot prompt that guides the chatbot to respond with insights and perspectives derived from the interplay of these two domains. Complete the prompt with a bullet list of 7 cardinal principles to follow for the target chatbot."

6. **Response Evaluation**: The final stage involves a comprehensive evaluation of the responses generated by Cohere, GPT3.5, and GPT4 models. This evaluation is not only based on the chatbot prompt but also includes a detailed analysis using the Cohere Classifier API. This classifier is trained on the same index used to create the user-defined perspective, ensuring its alignment with the expected output.

The effectiveness of the influence of the prompt is then determined by comparing the classifier scores between the prompted and unprompted model responses. A higher score indicates a stronger alignment with the user-defined perspective, thus reflecting a more successful implementation of our Perspective-Driven Prompting methodology.

By combining relevance, depth of insight, and adherence to the user-defined perspective with the sophisticated classification scoring, this stage ensures that the final chatbot response is contextually accurate, insightful, and truly reflective of the user's perspective.
