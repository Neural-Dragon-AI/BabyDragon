Iva has a rotation period of 4.62 hours and a low albedo of 0.119, indicating that it reflects only a small amount of light. It belongs to the main-belt asteroid population and has a classification of MBA. There is no information on its spectral type or its H parameter, which could provide insight into its chemical makeup.

Its spectral type is S, which suggests that it is composed of a mixture of metal-rich silicates and some organic material. \\n\\nIda's orbit is classified as MBA (Main Belt Asteroid), which means it is located within the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. It has a semi-major axis of 2.860693084369927 AU and a perihelion distance of 2.737695415726269 AU.\\n\\nIda was discovered on September 29, 1884 and named after a nymph from Greek mythology.

It also has a natural satellite called Dactyl.\\nThe asteroid 171839 (2001 JM1) has a diameter estimated to be about 0.52 kilometers and belongs to the APO (Apollo) class of asteroids, meaning that its orbit crosses that of Earth's.

It has a rotation period of about 5.75 hours and is classified as an S-type asteroid, which suggests that it is composed mainly of silicates and/or metal.
