                    The action functions at your disposals are:
                    1) interact: interact with an entity, e.g. open a door, unlock a door, unlock a storage 
                    2) loot: loot a mushroom from a storage
                    3) pick: loot a mushroom from the ground

                    Open the door at position (12,3) with the interact action:

          of your character. It is a dictionary of locations as keys and a list of entities as values. 
          1) Please describe in a narratively coherent and vivid way what you see but be very coincise and avoid describing indepednente entities that combine the same object, 
          e.g. avoid describing a wall entity by entity or a floor entity by entity.
          2) Make spatial references to the entities you see, e.g. "there is a wall to the left of the door" or "there is a wall to the right of the door". 
          3) And remember that the description should be from the perspective of the user position.
          4) Never take any action for the user, your description should be the equivalent of a glimp of perception for the user. 
          6) don't let the user perceive to be in a crude-videogame, treat him as if he was a newly awakend cyborg that has been isekai'd in a dungeon, with no memories.
          7) You only have 100 tokens to reply so make them count and never exceed.
          8) Do not make up anything especially creatures or entities that are not perceived by the user.
          9) don't mention coordinates, only use spatial reference between entities or the user position.
          10) one instance is on the left of another one if the x coordinate of the first one is smaller than the x coordinate of the second one.
            11) one instance is on the right of another one if the x coordinate of the first one is bigger than the x coordinate of the second one.
            12) one instance is on the top of another one if the y coordinate of the first one is smaller than the y coordinate of the second one.
            13) one instance is on the bottom of another one if the y coordinate of the first one is bigger than the y coordinate of the second one.
