By iterating through the prices, the algorithm updates these variables based on the current price and the previous values.\n\n   Example Code:\n   ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def maxProfit(self, prices):\n            s1 = s2 = 0\n            b1 = b2 = -float(\"inf\")\n            for p in prices:\n                if -p > b1: b1 = -p\n                if b1 + p > s1: s1 = b1 + p\n                if s1 - p > b2: b2 = s1 - p\n                if b2 + p > s2: s2 = b2 + p\n            return s2\n   ```\n\n   Alternatively, the same problem can be solved using a simplified dynamic programming approach:\n\n   Example Code:\n   ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def maxProfit(self, prices):\n            dp = [-float('inf'), 0]\n            for p in prices:\n                x = max(dp[1] - p, dp[0])\n                y = max(dp[1], dp[0] + p)\n                dp = [x, y]\n            return dp[-1]\n   ```\n\n3. Problem: Job Scheduling\n   - The problem involves scheduling jobs with start times, end times, and associated profits. The goal is to maximize the total profit while avoiding job overlaps.\n   - Approach: These examples use a dynamic programming approach to solve the problem. The algorithm sorts the jobs based on their end times and iterates through them. For each job, it determines the maximum profit achievable by considering the previous jobs and selects the one that can yield the highest total profit without overlapping.\n\n   Example Code:\n   ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def jobScheduling(self, startTime, endTime, profit):\n            jobs = sorted(zip(startTime, endTime, profit), key=lambda v: v[1])\n            dp = [[0, 0]]\n            for s, e, p in jobs:\n                i = bisect.bisect(dp, [s + 1]) - 1\n                if dp[i][1] + p > dp[-1][1]:\n                    dp.append([e, dp[i][1] + p])\n            return dp[-1][1]\n   ```\n\n4. Problem: Maximum Profit (Alternative Solution)\n   - This problem is the same as the previous maximum profit problem but represented in a different way.\n   - Approach: The algorithm iterates through the prices and maintains a difference list consisting of the maximum profit and the current profit. For each price, it updates the difference list based on the current price and the previous profit values.\n\n   Example Code:\n   ```python\n    def maxProfit(self, prices):\n        diff_list = [0, 0]\n        for i in range(1, len(prices)):\n            if prices[i] - prices[i-1] + diff_list[1] >= 0:\n                diff_list[1] = prices[i] - prices[i-1] + diff_list[1]\n                diff_list[0] = max(diff_list[0], diff_list[1])\n            else:\n                diff_list[1] = 0\n        return diff_list[0]\n   ```\n\n   Alternatively, the same problem can be solved using the following class structure:\n\n   Example Code:\n   ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def maxProfit(self, prices):\n            diff_list = [0, 0]\n            for i in range(1, len(prices)):\n                if prices[i] - prices[i-1] + diff_list[1] >= 0:\n                    diff_list[1] = prices[i] - prices[i-1] + diff_list[1]\n                    diff_list[0] = max(diff_list[0], diff_list[1])\n                else:\n                    diff_list[1] = 0\n            return diff_list[0]\n   ```\n\nIn summary, the provided LeetCode problems demonstrate different approaches and algorithms.

Depth-First Search (DFS): Many of the provided solutions utilize a depth-first search approach. DFS is a recursive algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It is commonly used for traversing and searching in trees and graphs. In the provided code examples, DFS is employed to traverse the tree nodes, calculate sums, find specific values, validate tree structures, and more.\n\nExample:\n```python\ndef dfs(node):\n    if node:\n        # Perform operations on the current node\n        # Traverse the left subtree\n        dfs(node.left)\n        # Traverse the right subtree\n        dfs(node.right)\n```\n\n2.

The code uses a Counter to count the occurrences of each element in the array. It then iterates through the sorted array, checking if the current element and its double exist in the Counter. If they do, their counts are decremented. If the current element is even and its half exists in the Counter, their counts are also decremented. Finally, it checks if all counts in the Counter are zero.\n\n2. `fourSumCount`: This problem finds the number of quadruples `(A[i], B[j], C[k], D[l])` from four arrays that sum to zero. The solution uses a Counter to count the frequencies of sums of pairs from the first two arrays (A and B). It then iterates over the sums of pairs from the remaining two arrays (C and D) and checks if the negation of the sum exists in the Counter. The count of such pairs is then accumulated.\n\n3. `numSquarefulPerms`: The objective of this problem is to find the number of permutations of an array where the sum of every two adjacent elements is a perfect square. The code uses recursion (depth-first search) and backtracking. It first builds a graph `nex` that represents the possible transitions between numbers in the array that satisfy the perfect square condition. Then, it recursively explores the permutations and increments a counter `res` whenever a valid permutation is found. The algorithm keeps track of the counts of elements using a Counter and backtracks after each exploration.\n\n4. `splitArraySameAverage`: This problem aims to determine if an array can be split into two non-empty subsets with equal average. The solution employs a recursive function, `find`, to explore all possible subset sizes starting from 1 up to `n // 2`. The function checks if a solution is possible by recursively checking if the remaining elements can form subsets with equal sums. An optimization is used to store previously computed results in a `not_found` dictionary and avoid redundant computations.\n\n5. `countTriplets`: The goal is to count the number of triplets in an array where the bitwise AND of any two elements is zero. The code constructs a Counter to count the frequencies of bitwise ANDs between all pairs of elements in the array. It then sums up the counts for each element `a` that satisfies the condition `a & k = 0`, where `k` is any other possible element.\n\n6. `repeatedNTimes`: This problem finds the integer that occurs N times in an array of 2N elements. The solution uses the Counter to count the occurrences of each element and returns the most common element.\n\n7. `subarrayBitwiseORs`: The objective is to find the number of unique bitwise ORs of subrange elements in the given array. The code uses dynamic programming and bit operations. It maintains two sets: `nums` to store the unique OR results and `pre` to store the OR results of all subranges ending at the current element. By iterating over the array and updating these sets, it accumulates the unique OR results.\n\n8. `largestUniqueNumber`: This problem determines the largest unique number in an array, returning -1 if there is no such number. The solution uses the Counter to count the occurrences of each element in the array. It filters out the elements with count 1 and returns the largest among them, or -1 if none exist.\n\n9. `canThreePartsEqualSum`: This problem checks if an array can be partitioned into three non-empty parts with equal sums. The code computes the target sum by dividing the sum of the array by 3. It then iterates over the array, accumulating the sum `sm` and incrementing a counter `cnt` whenever `sm` reaches the target sum. Finally, it checks if `cnt` is equal to 3.\n\n10. `longestArithSeqLength`: The objective here is to find the length of the longest arithmetic subsequence in an array. The solution uses dynamic programming and a defaultdict. It iterates over the array, building up a defaultdict `dp`, which stores the lengths of arithmetic subsequences ending at each index. The length is updated by checking the difference between the current element and previous elements and maximizing the subsequence length accordingly.\n\nFrom the analysis above, we observe common structures, data types, and algorithms that can guide programmers in approaching similar problems:\n\n1.

Problem 1: Interleaving String (dfs(i, j, k) function)\n   - The problem involves checking if a string can be formed by interleaving two other strings.\n   - The solution uses depth-first search (DFS) with memoization to explore all possible interleavings.\n   - The function `dfs(i, j, k)` takes three indices: `i` for string 1, `j` for string 2, and `k` for the combined string.\n   - Memoization is used to avoid redundant computations and store the results for future reference.\n   - The solution checks if the current character of string 3 matches the characters from string 1 and string 2, and recursively calls the `dfs` function for possible interleavings.\n   - This problem illustrates the application of DFS and memoization to efficiently explore all possible combinations.\n\n2. Problem 2: Encode String with Shortest Length (dfs(i, j) function)\n   - The problem involves encoding a string with the shortest possible length in a specific format.\n   - The solution also uses DFS with memoization to find the shortest encoded string.\n   - The function `dfs(i, j)` takes two indices: `i` for the start of the current substring and `j` for the end of the substring.\n   - Memoization is used to store the minimum length encoding for each substring.\n   - The solution iterates over possible splitting points in the substring and recursively calls `dfs` for each split, comparing the resulting encodings.\n   - Additionally, the solution considers the possibility of repeating substrings by comparing parts of the string to identify repeating patterns.\n   - This problem showcases the use of DFS and memoization to explore the possible encodings and identify repeating patterns.\n\n3.

These methods are typically used as constructors to initialize the objects of the respective classes. Let's analyze the shared characteristics and patterns in these code snippets.\n\n1. Most of the classes have an `__init__` method that takes one or more arguments to initialize the object's state.\n\n   Example:\n   ```python\n   def __init__(self, value):\n       self.val = value\n       self.next = self.pre = None\n   ```\n   In this example, the class has an initializer that takes a single argument `value` and sets the object's attributes `val`, `next`, and `pre` accordingly.\n\n2. Several classes define multiple attributes within the `__init__` method. These attributes could be simple data types like integers, strings, or lists, or they could be references to other objects.\n\n   Example:\n   ```python\n   def __init__(self, k, v, f):\n       self.key = k\n       self.val = v\n       self.freq = f\n       self.next = self.pre = None\n   ```\n   Here, the class has four attributes `key`, `val`, `freq`, and `next`, which are initialized using the provided arguments.\n\n3. Some classes have additional attributes that are not directly given as arguments to the `__init__` method. These attributes are initialized separately within the method using specific values or data structures.\n\n   Example:\n   ```python\n   def __init__(self):\n       self.k, self.res = 0, None\n   ```\n   In this case, the class initializes two attributes `k` and `res` with specific values of `0` and `None`, respectively.\n\n4. There are cases where objects within the class contain references to other objects, which form a data structure or a linked structure.\n\n   Example:\n   ```python\n   def __init__(self, value, index):\n       self.val = value\n       self.i = index\n       self.pre = self.next = None\n   ```\n   Here, the class initializes attributes `val`, `i`, `pre`, and `next`, which are used to form a linked structure.\n\n5. Some classes make use of predefined data structures or patterns specific to the problem they solve. For example, a Trie data structure, a priority queue, or a binary tree structure.\n\n   Example:\n   ```python\n   def __init__(self):\n       self.children = [None] * 26\n       self.last = False\n   ```\n   In this case, the class represents a node in a Trie data structure. The `children` attribute is an array of size 26, representing child nodes, and the `last` attribute is a boolean flag indicating the end of a word.\n\nFrom the analysis, we can derive a generalized set of principles that might guide a programmer in approaching similar problems:\n\n1.

Base cases with leaf nodes: Several solutions define base cases using leaf nodes (nodes without any children). For example, in the \"isSymmetric\" problem, the base case is when both the left and right children of a node are None.\n\n5. Condition checks and comparisons: The solutions often include conditional statements to check for specific conditions or compare values. For instance, in the \"isUnivalTree\" problem, the program checks if the value of the left child is equal to the value of the root.\n\n6. Accumulators and intermediate data structures: Some solutions leverage accumulators or intermediate data structures to store and manipulate intermediate results during tree traversal. These structures may contain partial sums, lists of values, or dictionaries to track information across recursive calls.\n\nBased on these common characteristics, we can abstract a generalized strategy or set of principles to guide programmers in approaching similar problems involving tree structures. This strategy includes:\n\n1. Define recursive functions: Specify the base cases and recursive calls for the function that operates on tree nodes.\n\n2. Identify traversal order: Determine the order in which nodes should be visited during the traversal. It can be pre-order, in-order, post-order, or level-order, depending on the specific problem requirements.\n\n3. Use conditional statements: Incorporate condition checks and value comparisons as necessary to handle different scenarios or conditions during tree traversal.\n\n4. Consider intermediate data structures: If required, utilize accumulators or intermediate data structures to store and manipulate information during recursive calls.\n\n5. Analyze the problem-specific requirements: Understand the specific problem requirements and adapt the generic strategy accordingly.\n\nLet's demonstrate an example solution using the principles discussed above. We'll implement the \"isSymmetric\" problem as it encompasses several of the common characteristics:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def isSymmetric(self, root):\n        def isMirror(node1, node2):\n            if node1 is None and node2 is None:\n                return True\n            elif node1 is None or node2 is None:\n                return False\n            else:\n                return (\n                    node1.val == node2.val\n                    and isMirror(node1.left, node2.right)\n                    and isMirror(node1.right, node2.left)\n                )\n\n        if root is None:\n            return True\n        else:\n            return isMirror(root.left, root.right)\n```\n\nIn this solution, the `isSymmetric` function determines if a tree is symmetric by checking if its left subtree is a mirror reflection of the right subtree. The `isMirror` function performs the recursive comparisons between corresponding nodes.\n\nThis example solution exemplifies several of the shared characteristics, including recursion, tree structure manipulation, conditional checks, and base cases.

Many solutions involve manipulating pointers: To perform operations such as reversing a linked list, removing a node, or reordering nodes, solutions often manipulate pointers to adjust the connections between nodes.\n\n3. Many solutions involve recursion: Recursive solutions are common when dealing with linked lists, especially for operations such as reversing a linked list, swapping pairs of nodes, or creating a balanced binary search tree from a sorted list.\n\n4.

Sorting algorithms like insertion sort or merge sort appear in solutions for problems like \"sortList\" and \"insertionSortList\".\n\n6. Many solutions leverage mathematical principles: For example, in the \"nextLargerNodes\" problem, a max heap is used to find the next larger element. In the \"reorderList\" problem, the list is rearranged by manipulating the pointers.\n\nBased on these shared characteristics and patterns, we can derive a set of generalized strategies or principles to guide approaching similar problems:\n\n1. Consider iterative or recursive traversal: Many linked list problems involve iterating through the list, either in a forward or backward direction.

The implementation uses a trie data structure to efficiently store and search for sentences. The `__init__` method initializes the root of the trie and keeps track of the current node (`self.cur`) and the frequency of each sentence (`self.rank`). Each sentence is stored in the trie by iterating over its characters, moving to the corresponding child node, and adding the sentence to the list of sentences stored at that node. The `search` method retrieves the top three most frequent sentences under the current node. The `input` method takes a character as input, updates the current node and sentence accordingly, and returns the top three matching sentences if the input character is not '#'. If the input character is '#', the method increments the frequency of the current sentence, adds the sentence to the trie, resets the current node and sentence, and returns an empty list.\n\nThe `Leaderboard` class is an implementation of a game leaderboard. It tracks the scores of players and provides methods to add scores, retrieve the top K scores, and reset individual player scores. The implementation uses two data structures: `self.scores` and `self.p`. `self.scores` is a defaultdict that stores the scores as keys and sets of player IDs as values. `self.p` is a defaultdict that maps player IDs to their scores. The `addScore` method updates the score of a player by adding the new score and removing their previous score from `self.scores`. The `top` method retrieves the sum of the top K scores by iterating over the scores in descending order and accumulating the scores until the sum reaches or surpasses K. The `reset` method resets the score of a player by removing their previous score from `self.scores` and setting their score to 0.\n\nBoth classes utilize data structures like defaultdicts and heaps (implemented using the `heapq` module) to efficiently store and retrieve information. They also use similar strategies to retrieve top scores or sentences based on frequencies.\n\nIn summary, the common structures and paradigms employed in these code snippets include:\n- Trie data structure\n- defaultdict for efficient storage and retrieval\n- Sorting and manipulation of data using heapq\n- Accumulation and summation based on certain conditions\n\nThe generalized strategy or set of principles that can guide a programmer in approaching similar problems include:\n1.

Depth-first search (DFS): Many of the code snippets are implementing the DFS algorithm. DFS is a recursive search algorithm that explores a graph or tree by visiting one vertex and then recursively exploring all its adjacent vertices before backtracking. It is used in various problems for traversing and searching through states or combinations.\n\nExample:\n```python\ndef dfs(i):\n    if i >= n:\n        return 1 if i == n else 0\n    if i not in memo:\n        memo[i] = dfs(i + 1) + dfs(i + 2)\n    return memo[i]\n```\n\n2. Backtracking: Backtracking is a technique used to find all possible solutions or combinations by exploring all potential options and removing those that do not satisfy the problem constraints. It is often used in combination with DFS.\n\nExample:\n```python\ndef dfs(l, r, p1, p2, turn):\n    if l > r:\n        return p1 >= p2\n    elif turn:\n        return dfs(l + 1, r, p1 + nums[l], p2, 0) or dfs(l, r - 1, p1 + nums[r], p2, 0)\n    else:\n        return dfs(l + 1, r, p1, p2 + nums[l], 1) and dfs(l, r - 1, p1, p2 + nums[r], 1)\n```\n\n3. Dynamic Programming and Memoization: Dynamic programming (DP) is an optimization technique that breaks down a problem into smaller overlapping subproblems and solves each subproblem only once, storing the solutions in a table to avoid redundant computations. Memoization is the process of caching the results of expensive function calls and reusing the cached results when the same inputs occur again.\n\nExample:\n```python\nmemo = {}\n\ndef dfs(arr, total):\n    s = str(arr)\n    if s in memo:\n        return memo[s]\n    elif arr[-1] >= total:\n        return True\n    for i in range(len(arr)):\n        if not dfs(arr[:i] + arr[i + 1:], total - arr[i]):\n            memo[s] = True\n            return True\n    memo[s] = False\n    return False\n```\n\n4. Conditionals and Recursive Patterns: Many code snippets use conditionals and recursive patterns to explore different paths or handle different cases based on specific conditions. These patterns are commonly used to decide when to backtrack or terminate the recursion.\n\nExample:\n```python\ndef dfs(cnt, num):\n    if not cnt:\n        self.res += 1\n    for new in nex[num]:\n        if cnt[new]:\n            cnt[new] -= 1\n            if not cnt[new]:\n                cnt.pop(new)\n            dfs(cnt, new)\n            cnt[new] += 1\n```\n\nBased on these common characteristics and patterns, we can extract a generalized strategy or set of principles for approaching similar problems:\n\n1.
