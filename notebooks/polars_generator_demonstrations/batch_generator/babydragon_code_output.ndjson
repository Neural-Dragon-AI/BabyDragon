This class extends the \"cst.CSTVisitor\" class, indicating that it is intended to be used to traverse and analyze a concrete syntax tree (CST).\n\nThe constructor method takes a single argument \"code\" which is a string representing Python code. It initializes two instance variables: \"module\", which holds the parsed representation of the input code using the \"cst.parse_module()\" function, and \"left_shift_assign_operator_count\" which is initially set to 0.\n\nThe class defines a method called \"visit_LeftShiftAssign\" which takes a \"cst.LeftShiftAssign\" node as an argument. This method is invoked when a left shift assignment operator (<<=) is encountered in the CST traversal. It increments the \"left_shift_assign_operator_count\" variable by 1 and returns True.\n\nThe class also defines a method called \"collect\" which is responsible for visiting the CST using the \"module.visit()\" method. This method will invoke the \"visit_LeftShiftAssign\" method for each left shift assignment operator found in the code. After the traversal is complete, it returns the final value of \"left_shift_assign_operator_count\".\n\nIn summary, the purpose of this code is to count the number of left shift assignment operators (<<=) present in a given Python code.", "prompt_tokens": 129, "completion_tokens": 272, "total_tokens": 401, "end_time": 1690082131, "remaining_token_capacity": 16}

This class overrides the `leave_FunctionDef` method to remove docstrings from function definitions.\n\nInside the `leave_FunctionDef` method, it extracts the docstring of the original function using another function called `extract_docstring` from a module called `PythonDocstringExtractor`. If the docstring starts with the string \"No docstring\", it returns the updated version of the function node without any changes.\n\nOtherwise, it uses the `with_changes` method to create a modified version of the function node. Specifically, it removes any statements from the function body that are of type `cst.SimpleStatementLine` and contain a `cst.SimpleString` expression as a subexpression.\n\nFinally, it applies the `DocstringRemover` transformer to the input `tree` module by calling the `visit` method on the `tree` object. This will traverse the entire AST of the module and apply the defined transformations. The modified `tree` object is then returned.", "prompt_tokens": 243, "completion_tokens": 261, "total_tokens": 504, "end_time": 1690082290, "remaining_token_capacity": 979}

The `Future` object is created by submitting a task to the executor to call another method called `_summarize_text` with the text as an argument. The key in the dictionary is the `Future` object, and the value is the corresponding text from `self.texts`. \n\nThe code then enters a loop using the `as_completed` function, which iterates over the completed `Future` objects in the `future_to_text` dictionary. Inside the loop, the text associated with the completed `Future` object is retrieved and stored in a variable called `text`. \n\nThe code then tries to get the result of the `Future` object using the `result` method, and assigns the result to the `output` dictionary with the `text` as the key. If an exception occurs, it is caught and a message is printed.\n\nFinally, the `output` dictionary is returned from the method.", "prompt_tokens": 150, "completion_tokens": 292, "total_tokens": 442, "end_time": 1690082322, "remaining_token_capacity": 3141}

This method takes in a `query` parameter and an optional `max_results` parameter with a default value of 10.\n\nThe method starts by calling the `search` method of an `api` object, passing the `query` and `max_results` as arguments. The result is stored in the `search_results` variable.\n\nIf the `search_results` is not `None`, the code creates a `BeautifulSoup` object `soup` from the `search_results` using the \"html.parser\" parser.\n\nThe code then finds all the \"entry\" elements in the `soup` using the `find_all` method and stores them in the `entries` variable.\n\nA list called `paper_list` is created to store dictionaries of information about each paper found.\n\nThe code then iterates over each `entry` in `entries`. For each `entry`, it creates a dictionary called `paper_dict` to store information about that paper.\n\nThe `arxiv_id` is extracted by calling a private method `_parse_arxiv_id` and is then assigned to the \"arxiv_id\" key in `paper_dict`.\n\nThe `title`, `summary`, and `content` of the paper are extracted from the `entry` and assigned to their respective keys in `paper_dict`.\n\nIf the `content` of the paper is `None`, the code continues to the next `entry` without adding it to the `paper_list`.\n\nFinally, if all `entries` have been processed, the `paper_list` is returned. If the `search_results` is `None`, `None` is returned.\n\nThe code essentially searches for papers based on a query, extracts relevant information for each paper, and returns a list of dictionaries containing that information.", "prompt_tokens": 203, "completion_tokens": 367, "total_tokens": 570, "end_time": 1690082321, "remaining_token_capacity": 4926}
