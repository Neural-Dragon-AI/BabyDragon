Air resistance can significantly affect the trajectory of a projectile, causing it to deviate from the ideal angle for maximum distance.\n\nTo account for air resistance, mathematical models such as the drag equation can be used to estimate the effects of air resistance on the motion of the projectile. These models consider factors such as the shape and size of the object, its velocity, and the properties of the surrounding air.\n\nIn the case of wind, its direction and speed can be taken into account by adjusting the launch angle and/or adjusting the velocity of the throw to compensate for the wind's impact on the projectile's trajectory.\n\nExperimental testing in controlled environments or wind tunnels can also help determine the optimal throwing angle and technique under specific wind conditions.", "prompt_tokens": 1134, "completion_tokens": 164, "total_tokens": 1298, "end_time": 1694459991, "remaining_token_capacity": 137053}

It was a struggle to get up, and I ended up waking up late.\n\nAs you know, I've been practicing intermittent fasting, so I had to rush to eat before the fasting window closed. It was crucial for me to take my medication to keep the fever at bay, so I managed to eat just in time.\n\nDespite feeling unwell, I decided to go to work. It was a hectic day with many tasks piling up, but fortunately, the medication helped me muster the energy to get through everything.\n\nBy the time I got home, I was completely drained from the demanding workload. I eagerly awaited the time to eat again and replenish my energy. I indulged in a hearty meal and some refreshing drinks to rejuvenate myself.\n\nNow, I'm finally getting some much-needed rest. I'll be hitting the hay at my usual sleeping time of 8:00 PM. I hope tomorrow will bring a better day and that this flu passes quickly.\n\nHow have you been lately? I'd love to catch up and hear about what's been going on in your life.\n\nTake care and talk to you soon!\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]", "prompt_tokens": 1384, "completion_tokens": 290, "total_tokens": 1674, "end_time": 1694460020, "remaining_token_capacity": 2414}
