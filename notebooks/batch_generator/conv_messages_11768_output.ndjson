Libraries and tools like React Router, Axios, and Material-UI can be used. Finally, the app can be deployed on platforms like Heroku or GitHub Pages. Python can also be used to build web apps, with frameworks like Flask or Django for the backend and JavaScript for client-side interactions. Dash or Streamlit frameworks can be used for both frontend and backend.

As a text-based AI model, my capabilities are limited to generating text-based responses and summaries. However, I can explain the concept of combining value functions and policies.\n\nIn reinforcement learning, the combination of value functions and policies is commonly done through an iterative process called policy iteration. The basic idea is to alternate between evaluating a policy using a value function and improving the policy based on the evaluated values.\n\nHere is a high-level overview of the steps involved in policy iteration:\n\n1. Initialize a random policy.\n2. Evaluate the policy by estimating the value function. This can be done using methods like dynamic programming or Monte Carlo sampling.\n3. Improve the policy by selecting actions that lead to higher values. This is typically done by selecting the action with the highest value in each state.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the policy converges to an optimal policy.\n\nBelow is a pseudo code representation of policy iteration with comments describing each step:\n\n```javascript\n// Step 1: Initialize a random policy\nlet policy = initializeRandomPolicy();\n\nwhile (!policyConverged) {\n  // Step 2: Evaluate the current policy\n  let valueFunction = evaluatePolicy(policy);\n\n  // Step 3: Improve the policy\n  let newPolicy = improvePolicy(valueFunction);\n\n  // Check if the new policy has converged\n  if (newPolicy == policy) {\n    policyConverged = true;\n  }\n\n  // Update the current policy\n  policy = newPolicy;\n}\n\nfunction initializeRandomPolicy() {\n  // Code to initialize a random policy\n}\n\nfunction evaluatePolicy(policy) {\n  // Code to estimate the value function based on the current policy\n}\n\nfunction improvePolicy(valueFunction) {\n  // Code to update the policy based on the estimated value function\n}\n```\n\nNote that the actual implementation of policy iteration may vary depending on the specific RL framework or algorithms used. Also, this code snippet is just an example in a JavaScript-like syntax and may not execute directly.
