## Enhanced Working Memory in GOAP Framework with Past Memory Integration

### Introduction
The Enhanced Working Memory within the GOAP (Goal-Oriented Action Planning) Framework is designed to leverage past memory frameworks for a more dynamic and context-aware processing of conversations and tasks. This advanced memory system integrates current user inputs with historical data, forming a comprehensive GOAP representation of ongoing interactions.

### Integration of Past Memory Framework

#### Memory Components
1. **Short-Term Memory (STM)**: Captures recent interactions, serving as a dynamic log of current dialogues.
2. **Episodic Memory (EM)**: Stores historical conversation threads, providing context through past interactions.
3. **Associative Memory (AM)**: Organizes knowledge into concepts and abstractions, enriching the conversation with relevant information.

#### Information Bottleneck Principle
- **Function**: Filters and compresses information from STM, EM, and AM to focus on the most relevant data for the current user query.
- **Role**: Acts as a critical mediator in deciding what information from the past and present is pertinent to the current context and goals.

### GOAP Representation in Working Memory

#### Parsing and Structuring User Input
1. **User Message Processing**: Transforms user messages into structured GOAP entities and attributes.
2. **Incorporating Historical Context**: Enhances the interpretation of the current message with relevant historical data from EM and AM.

#### Goal Inference and World State Formulation
1. **Combining Current and Past Data**: Merges current user input with past memory to create a comprehensive view of the user's intent and the ongoing task.
2. **World State Update**: Reflects the combined knowledge from STM, EM, AM, and current input in the world state, ensuring a complete understanding of the conversation's context.

#### Action Planning and Adaptation
1. **Dynamic Action Formulation**: Uses the enriched world state to plan actions that are aligned with both the current goals and past interactions.
2. **Continuous Adaptation**: Adjusts plans and strategies based on new inputs and changing contexts, utilizing the full spectrum of memory components.

### Conclusion
The Enhanced Working Memory in the GOAP Framework represents a significant advancement in conversational AI systems. By integrating past memory frameworks, it ensures that every user interaction is informed by a rich context of historical data and current information. This approach not only enhances the accuracy of goal inference and action planning but also allows for more nuanced and adaptive responses in ongoing conversations.
