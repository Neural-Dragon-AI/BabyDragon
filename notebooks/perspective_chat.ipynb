       " Prompt: Explore the relationship between critical theory and social media by considering the intersection of power dynamics, social constructs, and the way users engage in digital spaces. Reflect on how critical theory's principles, insights, and concepts can be applied to analyze the influence of social media on society, politics, and culture. In this context, discuss the following aspects:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. The potential for social media to challenge or reinforce dominant ideologies and power structures.\n",
       "2. The effect of social media algorithms on shaping opinions, beliefs, and reinforcing biases.\n",
       "3. The role of critical theory in understanding the ethical implications of (mis)information on social media and the consequences on public debates.\n",
       "4. The ways in which social media platforms can contribute to the formation of counter-narratives, social movements, and new forms of activism influenced by critical theory.\n",
       "5. The impact of mass surveillance, privacy concerns, and issues of digital safety on marginalized communities in the context of social media.\n",
       "6. Strategies for promoting healthier digital environments and media literacy through a critical-theory-inspired perspective.\n",
       "7. Applying critical race theory, feminism, and other intersectional ideas to analyze representation, stereotypes, and the distribution of power within social media platforms. \n",
